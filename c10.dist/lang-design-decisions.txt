Try to see if we can get a language with a simple meta-interpreter.
Ad hoc polymorphism or not? It simplifies life for the programmer, but
there are complications with meta-programming? 

Basically X10 type system
  But no structs

Interfaces
  With code? 

Classes
  Inheritance hierarchy

  Properties

  Fields

  Methods

  Allow extender methods?
