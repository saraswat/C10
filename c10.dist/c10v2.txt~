C10 is a logic language with equality, and user-defined
constraints, agents and goals.

From a syntax point of view, the language is like that of Prolog with
the following major changes:

  (a) Object-orientation -- a program is made up of a number of class
      and interface declarations, organized in packages. Each class
      defines fields,  methods and constructors. Method definitions
      may be abstract, overloaded and overriding. An interface defines
      abstract methods; classes implement interfaces. Classes realize
      a single-inheritance hierachy but may implement multiple interfaces.  

      Methods and fields may be static or instance.

  (b) Strong typing: All expresions have a compile-time type. The
      compiler checks that only operations permitted by the type are
      performed on an expression. 

  (c) A distinction is made between the syntactic categories of
      agents, goals and constraints. (Prolog permits only goals.) This 
      reflects the basis of C10 in a richer subset of logic than
      definite clauses. Users may define symbols in all these categories. 

Methods are of three kinds -- constraint methods, goal methods and
agent methods. This is specified by a @Constraint, @Goal or @Agent
annotation on the method declaration. The body of an @Constraint,
@Goal, @Agent method must be a Constraint, Goal or Agent,
respectively. 

Each of these kinds of methods are either predicate methods or
function methods. 

Predicate methods are declared thus. (We illustrate with Goals. Similar
rules apply for agents and constraints.)

  <Qualifiers> <GoalName> [ '(' <ArgList> ')' ]  :- <Goal>.

and functions are declared thus:

  <Qualifiers> <GoalName> [ '(' <ArgList> ')' ] = <VarName> [':' <Type>] :- <Goal>.
  <Qualifiers> <GoalName> [ '(' <ArgList> ')' ] [ ':' <Type> =  <Term>  [ ':-' <Goal>] '.'

The body of a function method may constrain the result variable, just
as it may constrain any argument variable. The only difference between
predicate and function methods is that functional notation (nesting)
can be used to compose terms built from function names. During
compilation nested functional terms are flattened with new variables
used to represent the result of function application, e.g.
    
   Two=add(mult(A,B)) ==> M=mult(A,B), Two=add(M)

By explicitly naming the return value in the header we obviate the
need for a return statement. Constraints on the return variable may be
imposed at any place in the body of the method. 

This is basically the core language.

<ArgDeclList> ::= <ArgDecl> | <ArgDecl> ',' <ArgDeclList>
   

To be considered later:
  -- operators
  -- static imports


Map Reduce computations.

Agent closure literals are of the form:
  <AgentTerm> ::= (<ArgList>){<Goal>} => <AgentTerm>
                  | (<ArgList>){<Goal>} => <AgentTerm> groupby <AgentTerm>
e.g.
   (I: 1..N){even(I)} => I+1

Such a literal can be used to implicitly define a set, the set of all
values in the range of the function.
   V = set ((I: 1..N){even(I)} => I+1) // V = {3, 5, ... }

In conventional mathematical notation this would have been expressed
as:
    V = { I+1 | even(I), I in 1..N}

TODO: See if this is flexible enough. Is the generator powerful
enough?

Groupby clauses are also supported. In the production above,
 the first <AgentTerm> is called the value and the second (after the
 groupby) the key.

e.g. ((I: 1..N) => I groupby I/2) 

When such a function is applied to a value in its domain ("point-wise
evaluation"), it produces a pair, Pair(k, v), where k is the result of
evaluating the key, and v the value. The exhaustive evaluation of such
a function results in a map (realized as an array whose domain is given by
the set of possible key values) which associates each distinct key value k
with the set of all values v s.t. pointwise evaluation produces
Pair(k,v).

The central aspect of constraint programming -- unlike functional
programming -- is dealing with partial information.

We also want to be able to define expressions as types. Perhaps the
way to do this is:

type (I:Int)..(J:Int)=Int(I,J).
type (I:Long)..(J:Long)=Long(I,J).

That is, we permit the range operator to be overloaded so that it can
be used to construct types, as well as values.
