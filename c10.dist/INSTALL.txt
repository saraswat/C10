This program is controlled by the Eclipse Public Licence v1.0.

This is a distribution of the C10 Programming Language.
http://c10-lang.org/

To complete the installation, the scripts in bin/ may need to be made
executable.

Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to the
directory where you find bin/java.

Java backend instructions
-------------------------
To compile an C10 source program using the Java backend, invoke
"bin/c10c <class_name>.c10".
See "bin/c10c --help" for command-line help.

To run the compiled C10 class, invoke "bin/c10 <class_name>".
See "bin/c10 --help" for command-line help.

C10 programs compile into X10 programs. In this version, the generated
X10 programs run in a single place. 

C++ backend instructions
------------------------
To compile an C10 source program using the C++ backend, invoke
"bin/c10c++ -o <class_name> <class_name>.c10".  This will
produce an executable named "<class_name>" in the current
directory[*].

To run the compiled C10 executable in one place, invoke
./<class_name>.


[*] On Cygwin, the name will be "<class_name>.exe".  
the -o argument may be omitted, but the compiler will then produce 
an executable with the default name ("a.out" on Unix, "a.exe" on Cygwin).
Also, on Cygwin you either need to use the x10.dist/bin/runx10 script
to run the compiled executable or ensure that you include both
x10.dist/lib and x10.dist/stdlib/lib in your load library path.
