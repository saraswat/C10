This is a source distribution of the 
C10 Programming Language (http://x10-lang.org/).

Detailed instructions for building C10 from source will eventually be found online
at http://c10-lang.org/c10-development/building-c10-from-source.html.

In a nutshell, building C10 is driven by ant.  

If you have the prerequisites installed on your machine 
(see the online documentation for details), then building C10 
from source can be done with a single ant command:

  cd c10.dist && ant -Doptimize=true dist
